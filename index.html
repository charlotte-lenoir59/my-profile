                <p>I'm currently studying at the IESEG School Of Management to gain a better understanding of the business world and to acquire the skills needed to enter the professional world. The Wagon project is also one of the skills I wanted to learn, and doing it has given me a lot of experience in coding.

            <h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
            <div class="skill-content">
                When I was 16, I set up my own online business. I created a single-product site to discover what the commercial world was all about. I designed ads and set them up on facebook and google ads. I loved this experience, it gave me a goal that kept me going, both professionally and personally. That's where my passion for entrepreneurship comes from.

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <div class="skill-content">
                Music is an integral part of my life. It's what helps me rest my mind when things start to get complicated. I'm in a band, I've already done a few concerts and I create my own compositions on the side. It's something that brings me a lot of joy and peace of mind.

            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <div class="skill-content">
                When I was young, I always dreamed of discovering new cultures, new horizons and new languages. When I was 11, I went to Senegal with my family, and it was one of the most refreshing and enriching experiences I've ever had. That's why traveling is something that will be an integral part of my life in the future, and it's a big part of the reason why I enrolled at IESEG, for its international outlook.
